# Bangkit Capstone Project: **_Memorabilia_** - Transforming the Way You Read (**C241-PS182**)
 Indonesia is currently experiencing a literacy crisis, with a significant drop in interest in reading books. Several factors contribute to this issue including a lack of intrinsic drive to read and problems in discovering books that meet personal interests. Visgastis and Tada's 2020 study found that **watching progress can increase the incentive to read**. However, prior systems have largely failed to successfully leverage this understanding.

To address this issue, our team developed an approach that motivates reading through progress tracking and personalized recommendations. Our mobile app, named "Memorabilia", will increase reader engagement via **progress tracking** and **unique personalized recommendations** and seeks to increase literacy rates in Indonesia by improving book availability and accessibility based on reader preferences.
