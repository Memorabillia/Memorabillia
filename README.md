### Model Architecture
Our main focus in this capstone is how to build a model that predicts ratings based on user ID. There are 3 stages. First, we had **preprocessing** which included **collecting, formatting, and cleaning** the data such as removing unused columns, missing values, and data imbalance. The second was **modeling** where we used **Neural Collaborative Filtering** as the base. Last is **deploying** where we **make an API using Flask to serve and deploy the models** in Google Cloud Platform.
